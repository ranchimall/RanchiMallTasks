# RanchiMallTasks
This is a pipeline of tasks that RanchiMall needs to get executed

# Execution Steps 
As a start point, a project will be named as per the strategic requirements of RanchiMall  
A team will be nominated that will work on that project. Those who do not perform well will drop off.
The team will conduct design discussions, and come up with two outputs: Design Document and list of tasks.
Design documents will be created on the project repository wiki page in GitHub itself
List of tasks will be uploaded in RIBC App for execution and monitoring
